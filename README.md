# AiSD
This repository is created for tasks and programs from Algorithms and Structure of Data.  
Repository structure:

-GRAFY - contains implementation of graph algorithms
--(DAG graph)
--- DFS algorithm
--- BFS algorithm
--- Topological sort
--- Automatical generator of DAG(50% of fuless)
--- 3 representation of graph

--(Undirected graph)
--- Hamiltonian cycle & path
--- Euler's cycle & path
--- Automatical generator of undirected graph(30% of fulness and 70% of fulness)

-TREES
--BST
--- search MIN and MAX values
--- print a tree with pre-order or in-order method
--- delete one key in the tree
--- delete whole tree with post-order method
--- balance a tree 
--AVL

-ALGORYTMY
-- insertion sort
-- selection sort
-- shell sort
-- heap sort
-- quick sort(right pivot)
-- quick sort(random pivot)
