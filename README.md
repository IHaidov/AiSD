*This repository is created for tasks and programs from Algorithms and Structure of Data.  
Repository structure:*

# GRAFY - contains implementation of graph algorithms
## (DAG graph)
- DFS algorithm
- BFS algorithm
- Topological sort
- Automatical generator of DAG(50% of fuless)
- 3 representation of graph

# (Undirected graph)
- Hamiltonian cycle & path
- Euler's cycle & path
- Automatical generator of undirected graph(30% of fulness and 70% of fulness)

# TREES
## BST & AVL
- search MIN and MAX values
- print a tree with pre-order or in-order method
- delete one key in the tree
- delete whole tree with post-order method
- balance a tree 

# ALGORYTMY
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- shell sort
- heap sort
- quick sort(right pivot)
- quick sort(random pivot)
